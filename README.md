# Darts
Keep track of who wins at darts in Raleigh. I hope to add the degree of victory
and ultimately an Elo ranking of the dart players in the Raleigh office.

# The Actual Goal
Daniel needs to learn python and become more comfortable in git. Hopefully this helps.

# Things to add
* Plot function to plot current distribution of all or subset of players
* Some semblance of memory to track a player's progress over time
