# Darts
Keep track of who wins at darts in Raleigh.

There are three main scripts. _Density.py_ contains the density function that actually simulates games. _Games.py_ keeps a running list of games that have been played and their results. _MyPlots.py_ has plotting functions. The last python script (_Socks.py_) was just a crutch in the beginning with a simpler problem.

# The Actual Goal
Daniel needs to learn python and become more comfortable in git. Hopefully this helps.

# Things to add
* Incorporate time, down-weighting games that were played earlier
